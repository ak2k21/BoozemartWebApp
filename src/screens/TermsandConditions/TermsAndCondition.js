                When using the Sites, please be sure to use the "My Location" button at top righthand corner of the landing page,

                In these Terms, "you" and "your" refer to each Visitor and his or her agents (unless the context requires otherwise), 
                and "we", "us" and "our" refer collectively to Total Wine.

                our Privacy Policy, and any additional terms and conditions that are referenced herein or that otherwise may apply to specific sections of the Site, or to 
                products and services that we make available to you through the Site (all of which are deemed part of these Terms & Conditions). These Terms & Conditions are
